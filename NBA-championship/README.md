## Toughest Road to a NBA Championship

This project was inspired by the youtuber, JxmyHighroller, and he is a great sports analyst that brings fascinating intakes on NBA debates. Many of his
videos are supported by him using data, metrics, and visualizations, which is why I enjoy his videos very much. He had made a video on which NBA championship
team had the hardest and easiest road to a championship. I used this video as an inspiration to do my own version of analysis.

I use a lof of the same data and numbers as JxmyHighroller because I also wanted to see them coded and worked out on Python. I was also hoping to use some
of my own analytics skills to find something interesting that maybe wasn't mentioned in the video. I hope this first project opens up various more NBA or
sport-related projects for me in the future.

This project includes the [source code](), [project report](), and [powerpoint]().

Enjoy!
