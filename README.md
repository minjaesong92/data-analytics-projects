## Introduction
Hello and welcome to my data analytics portfolio where there are various projects done in Python, R, Tableau, and Spark. In this repo, there are a few projects I had completed during my coursework at Cal Poly Pomona. Some others were done in pure interest and for future investment after gaining the necessary skills in data analytics. My love for data had started after learning and understanding the possibilities we can achieve through smart, efficient analytics. Ever since then, I have always wanted to start as a data analyst and scientist and eventually become a professional in various aspects of the data cycle.

All projects were done in Jupyter Notebook -  Python, R Studio, Tableau, and Spark on AWS. I hope to continue my growth in the skills and want to share my projects with anyone that has a similar interest. Hope you all enjoy and maybe find something interesting!


## Google Data Analytics Capstone Project

 This project was part of the Google Data Analytics Certification on CourseEra.

 This project was done during my Advanced Data Analytics Course at CalPoly Pomona. Text Mining Airbnb Reviews to Calculate Future, Possible Yield, and
 Exploratory Analysis for tips new and current listers to increase yield. This was a very rigorous project that required many hours of data collecting,     processing, analyzing, etc.
 I want to thank my group partners Stephen C., and Dylan A. for helping each other finish the project.

## Machine Learning in Stocks

I have always been interested in Stocks ever since I had done well in a virtual stock game during my Accounting course. However, I never really had the 
courage to make big investments and didn't think it woud pay off especially when my starting funds weren't as high as in the virtual stock game. However,
once I had some money saved up and some skills, I wanted to analyze stock prices, predict future trends, and make smart investments.

## Big Data On Spark - Bike Sharing

This project was done on AWS EMR on a Spark-Jupyter notebook. The relevant course for this project was Big Data Analytics, and our professor had
introduced us to AWS and some of their incredible data solutions. This project required use to utilize cloud resources for storage, preparing, processing, analyzing, and for visualizations. I would like to thank my partner, Stephen A., for helping with this project.

## Toughest Road to Championship

 This project was inspired a Youtube video made my "JxmyHighroller" where he explains using data, metrics, and visualizations to portray the toughest road to a NBA Championship. This project is based on my interest in wanting to see for myself the actual results while doing some explanatory analysis. I was hoping to find some new points or trends while going through the data and metrics in the video using Python.
