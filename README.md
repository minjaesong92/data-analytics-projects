## Introduction
Hello and welcome to my data analytics portfolio where there are various projects done in Python, R, Tableau, and Spark. In this repo, there are a few projects I had completed during my coursework at Cal Poly Pomona. Some others were done in pure interest and for future investment after gaining the necessary skills in data analytics. My love for data had started after learning and understanding the possibilities we can achieve through smart, efficient analytics. Ever since then, I have always wanted to start as a data analyst and scientist and eventually become a professional in various aspects of the data cycle.

All projects were done in Jupyter Notebook -  Python, R Studio, Tableau, and Spark on AWS. I hope to continue my growth in the skills and want to share my projects with anyone that has a similar interest. Hope you all enjoy and maybe find something interesting!
