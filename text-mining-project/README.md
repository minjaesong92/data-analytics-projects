## Text Mining Project - Airbnb

Welcome to the Airbnb Text Mining Project, where we will look to calculate future possible yield using text mining on reviews and other dimensions.

This project was done in the course, Advanced Data Analytics, in Cal Poly Pomona. The project was done among three group members, and I would like to thank
and credit Stephen C., and Dylan A. for their hard work and contributions in this project.

In this project, you will find the [data](), [project report](), [source code](), and a [powerpoint presentation](). We used various methods and techniques learned from class and 
the internet and hope you find something interesting.

Thank you!
