## Bike Sharing Project on AWS EMR - Spark

Welcome to my first project done on AWS EMR - Spark! This project was done during my "Big Data Analytics" course at Cal Poly Pomona. This project shows
how effective and useful cloud resources can be when dealing with "big data". In this project, we were required to work in pairs, and I would like to thank
and credit my team partner, Stephen C., for his contribution and effort in this project.

In this project, the data was stored in Amazon S3 and the source code was done in a Jupyter notebook with the Spark language. In this project, we also used
machine learning to predict future bike sharing usage and trends within the riders. The project includes the [source code](https://github.com/minjaesong92/data-analytics-projects/blob/main/bike-sharing-spark/Final_Project_v3.ipynb) and a [powerpoint](https://github.com/minjaesong92/data-analytics-projects/blob/main/bike-sharing-spark/CIS%204567%20-%20Big%20Data%20-%20Bike%20Rentals.pdf). Some of
the graphs, in the powerpoint, were done in Tableau to show more effective visualizations.
Hope you enjoy!
