# Welcome to the Google Data Analytics Capstone project!
This project was part of the Google Data Analytics Certificate, where the course goes through various concepts needed in the data cycle. Through hours
of practice on SQL, Excel, R, and Powerpoint, we were able to complete a capstone project that highlights important features of data analytics. The data
was given along the project, but I have completed the project with more recent historical data. Hope you enjoy!

In this project, we will be analyzing bike sharing data on R and create profiles for our users.


Here, you can find the [project outline](), [source code](), [project report](), and [powerpoint presentation]().
All my work can be viewed, referenced, and slightly modified if needed.
Please also let me know if there are any errors or confusion!

Thank you and please enjoy!
