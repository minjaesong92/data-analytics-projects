## Machine Learning to Predict Future Stock Price and Trends

Welcome to my personal and experimental project, where I use machine learning to predict future behavior on stocks.
This project was used for my personal analysis in making long-term investments.
I always wanted to invest in stocks but was always scared of losing money. I also didn't think the payback would be as great especially when investing with
limited and minimal funds. I took on this project for my personal interest and analysis because I wanted to see what the data would tell me about certain
stocks I wanted to invest in. This project will explore, analyze, and predict future prices and trends for these certain stocks.

After leaving my investments with these certain companies, I have seen close to 60% growth with my original funds which ensures me that some of the data
and trends were in the right direction. I am also investing long-term with these companies, so I wasn't really trying to make huge growth in a short period
of time.

This project will contain the [source code](), [project report](), and a [follow-up report]().
Hope you enjoy!
